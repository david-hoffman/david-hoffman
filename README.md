### My name is [David P. Hoffman](https://david-hoffman.github.io).

I'm a **scientist/engineer** who builds **robust, high-performance optical systems** and loves **data** and **python**

I've probed [ultrafast chemical reactions](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.accounts.5b00508), imaged [nanoscale protein ultrastructure relationships](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6475/eaaz5357), and implemented a [high throughput screening platform](https://www.eikontx.com). Now I'm applying [optics ðŸ”¬ to omics ðŸ§¬](https://www.10xgenomics.com).
